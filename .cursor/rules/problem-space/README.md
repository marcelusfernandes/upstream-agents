# Problem Space Agents (Phase 1)

## Overview

The Problem Space consists of 7 specialized agents (Agents 0-6) that systematically analyze customer research data to identify and document core problems, pain points, and current-state processes. This phase transforms raw interview data into strategic problem statements, actionable insights, and AI-ready visual journey maps.

### 📊 Agent 5: Strategic Report Generator
**Input:** All previous analyses and consolidated journey  
**Output:** Executive-ready strategic reports (pain + problem)  
**Purpose:** Synthesize findings into actionable business reports

**Key Tasks:**
- Generate pain point report with impact analysis
- Create comprehensive problem statement report
- Provide strategic recommendations and next steps

### 🎨 Agent 6: Visual Journey Designer
**Input:** Consolidated journey + pain point mapping  
**Output:** Figma Make-ready journey visualization  
**Purpose:** Create AI-ready visual specifications for journey maps

**Key Tasks:**
- Generate structured output for Figma Make
- Implement badge system with severity/impact coding
- Create horizontal layout specifications (600px stages)
- Map pain points, needs, opportunities, and hypotheses to stages

## Templates & Dependencies

### Required Templates
- `_output-structure/problem-space/interview-analysis-template.md`
- `_output-structure/problem-space/pain-point-analysis-template.md`
- `_output-structure/problem-space/journey-mapping-template.md`
- `_output-structure/problem-space/report-template.md`

### Supporting Files
- `_output-structure/problem-space/model-structure.md`
- `_output-structure/workflow-rules.md`

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following exist before starting:
- `/0-documentation/0a-projectdocs/` with context files
- `/0-documentation/0b-Interviews/` with interview transcripts
- All required template files in `_output-structure/`

### 2. Execution Modes
- **End-to-End:** Sequential execution without interruption
- **Step-by-Step:** Agent-by-agent with approval gates

### 3. Trigger Commands
```
start workflow
begin analysis  
run agents
start process
execute workflow
```

### 4. Quality Gates
- **Agent 3 → Agent 4:** Explicit user confirmation required
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2:** Mandatory checkpoint before solution design

## Output Quality Standards

### Data Integrity Requirements
- ✅ **Source Attribution:** All findings reference original interview files
- ✅ **Conservative Language:** No invented metrics or unsubstantiated claims
- ✅ **Evidence-Based:** All conclusions supported by interview data
- ✅ **Assumption Transparency:** Clear documentation of inferences vs. facts

📋 **Guardrail Documentation:** See `/_agents/GUARDRAILS-ENFORCEMENT.md` for detailed rules on data integrity, approved language patterns, and automated validation.

### Deliverable Standards
- **Interview Analyses:** Complete coverage of all interview files
- **Pain Point Clusters:** Logical grouping with impact assessment
- **Journey Maps:** Stage-by-stage breakdown with touchpoints
- **Strategic Reports:** Executive-ready with actionable recommendations

## Success Metrics

### Completeness
- [ ] All interview files processed into structured analyses
- [ ] Pain points clustered and mapped to process stages
- [ ] Current-state journey documented comprehensively
- [ ] Strategic reports generated with clear recommendations

### Quality
- [ ] Consistent terminology across all deliverables
- [ ] Cross-references maintained for traceability
- [ ] Business impact quantified where possible
- [ ] Actionable insights identified for Phase 2

- [ ] Problem statement clearly articulated
- [ ] Pain point priorities established
- [ ] Current-state baseline documented
- [ ] Solution space requirements defined

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Missing Interview Files
**Issue:** No files in `/0-documentation/0b-Interviews/`  
**Solution:** Agent 1 creates placeholder noting absence for downstream agents

### Inconsistent Data Quality
**Issue:** Interview files in different formats  
**Solution:** Agent 1 extracts key information consistently using template structure

### Complex Journey Variations
**Issue:** Multiple different processes across interviews  
**Solution:** Agent 4 documents variations and creates conditional journey tracks

### Conflicting Pain Points
**Issue:** Different perspectives on same issue  
**Solution:** Document both perspectives with context in consolidation phase

## Integration Points

### Workflow Orchestrator
- Automated agent sequencing and dependency management
- Quality validation between agents
- Progress tracking and resumption capability

### Solution Phase (Phase 2)
- Problem reports feed into opportunity identification
- Pain point mapping drives solution prioritization
- Journey baseline enables future-state design

## Version History

- **v1.1.0** - Current stable version with template dependencies
- **v1.0.0** - Initial agent specification and workflow design
